This project is about optimising a call center service for a Dutch Insurance company and makes a recommendation on a workforce schedule for the future month of May 2023.

The files in this repository include:
1.) 'Break information-diversified' -> information of the breaks of the schedule made for the diversified workforce.
2.) 'Schedule-diversified' -> the schedule of the diversified workforce obtained with the lowest cost
3.) 'Schedule-Highlyskilled' -> the schedule of the highly-skilled workforce obtained with the lowest cost
4.) 'Selected shifts-diversified' -> the shifts (without being assigned to operators) of the diversified workforce selected that satisfy a pre-determined set of constraints from the Insurance company
5.) 'Selectedshifts-highlyskilled' -> the shifts (without being assigned to operators) of the highly skilled workforce selected that satisfy a pre-determined set of constraints from the Insurance company
6.) 'WorkforceComposition-diversified' -> all the workers of diversified types required for each hour of the month of May 2023
7.) 'WorkforceComposition-highlySkilled' -> all the highly skilled workers required for each hour of the month of May 2023

Note: these files are to be viewed together with the report 'Call Center Optimisation for a Dutch Insurance Company' by the same authors.
